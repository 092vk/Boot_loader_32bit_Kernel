## Boot loader

## Boot sequence : 

1. Real Mode : All the x86 cpu (Intel and AMD) starts in Real mode, a compatibility mode that emulates the original 8086
    - CPU behaves like a 16bit cpu
    - Only 1 MB of data is addressable
    - NO protection
    - Segment:offset addressing
    - Reason : Backward compatibility
    - Eventually the cpu is moved to other modes where it can access more memory


2. Protected Mode : Once the bootloader gets loaded the control moves from real mode to protected mode

3. Long Mode :
